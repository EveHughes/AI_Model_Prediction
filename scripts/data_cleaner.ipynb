The responses are either wrong ([THIS MODEL] can make obvious mistakes and never realize it when doing simple math computations or logic problems) or do not align with course expectations (a lack of rigorous justifications). For example, a question asked to construct a set that is bounded by several constraints. When reading the question, the question seems almost impossible to solve; when asking [THIS MODEL], it starts to give you sets that only obey part of the constraints but not all.
